# CodePath-iOS-Course

I am currently taking an iOS course offered by [CodePath.org](https://codepath.org) at City College of New York. This is a 6-week program where I will be building iOS applications using Swift (Storyboard).  
In this course, I will be building 3 Assignment Projects, 1 Group Project and 1 Lab Project: 
- Flixter - A read-only movie browsing app similar to Rotten Tomatoes *(Assignment)*
- Twitter - A read-write twitter client that allows users to view and compose tweets using the Twitter API *(Assignment)*
- Instagram - A read-write Instagram-style app built from the ground up using a custom configured backend *(Assignment)*
- Group Project - TBA
- Yelpy - A clone of Yelp *(Lab)*

## Labs

Throughout the course, I will also be doing lab sessions where I will have to build a clone version of Yelp application. 

The following are the things I will be learning during the lab sessions. 
- API: A Yelp Client that allows users to browse photos using the Yelp Fusion API
- AutoLayout: An extension of the Yelpy app which uses AutoLayout to adapt to various device sizes and orientations
- MVC: A re-factor of the Yelpy codebase to utilize a Model View Controller design payttern
- Animations: integrate Lottie and SkeletonViews in the app to add flare to the Yelpy app
- Chat/Messaging: A chat feature implementation that uses Parse as a Back-end
- Maps: A feature that allows a user to tag photos with location and view a restaurant on the map
